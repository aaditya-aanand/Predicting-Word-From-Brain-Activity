# Word Prediction From FMRI of Brain Activity

This is a Machine Learning Project completed under the mentorship of Dr. Piyush Rai at IIT Kanpur during August to November 2016. Following are the contributors of this project:

- Aaditya Aanand
- Pulkit Sharma
- Aryaman

## Problem Statement

There is a dictionary of 60 words and there are 300 persons. Each word has an associated 218 – D feature vector where the features describe some human defined attributes. Each person is being shown a word from the dictionary along with its “Line Drawing” and then FMRI image of the brain is captured which is represented as a 21764 – D feature vector of voxel intensities.

## This project contains:

- Proposal
- Mid Way Report
- Final Report
- Matlab Scripts
- Training and Test Datasets
