# Word Prediction From FMRI of Brain Activity

This is a Machine Learning Project completed under the mentorship of Dr. Piyush Rai at IIT Kanpur during August to November 2016. Following are the contributors of this project:

## Problem Statement

There is a dictionary of 60 words and there are 300 persons. Each word has an associated 218 – D feature vector where the features describe some human defined attributes. Each person is being shown a word from the dictionary along with its “Line Drawing” and then FMRI image of the brain is captured which is represented as a 21764 – D feature vector of voxel intensities.
The goal is to predict which word from two candidate words the person was thinking about, given the FMRI image of their brain.

## Prior Work On This Problem

Carnegie Mellon University has worked earlier on this problem with the following set of modifications:

1. The word was predicted from the dictionary of all 60 words rather than from two candidate words.

2. The prediction for a certain person was done by the training data from a different person, and the results were up to 90% accurate.
